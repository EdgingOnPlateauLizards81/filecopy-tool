## This program copies the contents of one file to another and prints counts of the non-whitespace characters in the terminal. 

## How to Compile and Run
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
	``` git clone https://github.com/EdgingOnPlateauLizards81/filecopy-tool.git ```


2. Navigate to the project directory.

3. Compile the code with `make` (sorry for the inconvenience of makefile, will be added soon) use `gcc` directly.
	For windows :
		compile :
		``` gcc filecopy.c -o filecopy```
	For bash :
		compile :
		```gcc filecopy.c -o filecopy```
